 * User-configurable settings (FR6). A plain domain model — persistence is an implementation
 * detail of whatever [SettingsRepository] is backing it.
 *
 * [varietyLevel] biases tip selection towards the philosophical/lighthearted tone pools rather
 * than switching them on or off outright — see [com.healthwidget.core.tips.TipEngine]'s `pick`
 * for the actual weighting. [VarietyLevel.PRACTICAL] by default: the practical wellness tips
 * are the app's core and stay the overwhelming majority until a user opts into more variety.
