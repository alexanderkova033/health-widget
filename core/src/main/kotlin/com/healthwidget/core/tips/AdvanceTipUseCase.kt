/**
 * Picks the next tip for [now] and records it in the shared recent-tips history — the one
 * rule that the nudge worker, the widget refresh worker, and the widget's first-render
 * fallback must all apply identically for the anti-repeat guarantee (FR5, no repeats within
 * the last [TipHistoryRepository.MAX_RECENT_TIPS] tips) to actually hold. Pulled out here so
 * those three call sites share one implementation instead of each re-deriving it.
 *
 * Read-select-persist is otherwise a classic read-modify-write race: a widget refresh and a
 * notification worker calling this concurrently could both read the same [recentTips][TipHistoryRepository.recentTips]
 * snapshot before either has persisted, and independently pick (and possibly repeat) the same
 * tip. [mutex] serializes the whole operation per process; it's a field on this class rather
 * than a `companion object`/top-level lock so it stays scoped to one [AdvanceTipUseCase]
 * instance — callers must share the single instance [com.healthwidget.app.AppContainer] already
 * hands out (a `by lazy` singleton) for the lock to actually cover every caller, which is also
 * exactly what the shared-instance design already required for the anti-repeat rule itself.
